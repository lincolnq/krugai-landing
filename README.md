# What this is

It's an example design for a landing page to explain the dangers of AI.

# Prereqs

This repo is built with hugo. I used 'v0.149.0+extended+withdeploy', but a later version is probably fine, I think it requires an 'extended' build though, which is true for the one from MacOS's Homebrew as of 2025.

# Running Locally

`hugo server` from the repo root should do the trick, then visit the local url it provides on the command line.
